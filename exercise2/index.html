    <p>The photo above appears to be a print or drawing  for the WPA Illinois Safety Division, prompting safety in the use of proper eye protection. The figure in the photo appears to be wearing goggles, while there are other figures in the background doing some sort of physical labor. Upon further research, its known that this piece was published during the Illinois: Federal Art Project between 1936 or 1937. </p>
